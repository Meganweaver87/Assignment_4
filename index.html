               <p>My performing background and my relationship with music can be a little hard to explain. I started playing the piano when I was five years old. My dad studied music theory and composition at Northwestern all the way through his graduate and postgraduate education, so it was important to him that we understand music. When talking about my childhood, I often say "we" or "us" because I'm an identical twin. I don't think he expected both of us to major in music in college ourselves, nor do I think that's the path he would have chosen for us because he knows it's a very tough path, but he always encouraged us to keep developing our skills. I took piano lessons for seventeen years, but I don't really consider myself a pianist. I'm naturally much more melodically-inclined, even if I do enjoy complex harmonies. I play the piano like a violinist and the violin like a pianist. I picked up the violin in fifth grade because I wanted to join the school orchestra. There are many kids who do this, but for kids who plan to pursue the violin seriously, starting at this age is considered very late. I struggled against favoritism and stressful competitive environments throughout my entire violin education. I always thought I would go to graduate school, but now I can't see myself spending hundreds of hours preparing music solely for the purpose of auditioning. I never felt the need to enter a competition, and I actually passed on auditioning for the state honors orchestra, but I would audition for extracurricular orchestras - jazz or pop ensembles, pit orchestras, touring orchestras, and even a baroque ensemble. As far as I can remember, I was never a soloist. There was always someone better. It's ironic now that I play multiple solos with the band. I also often get selected for smaller parts and play for weddings and events as well. I also did drum corps, which is the highest level of marching band. I don't play a band instrument though, so I joined the color guard and started dancing when my sister joined the marching band. I still love dancing, but I can't see myself continuing to dance professionally because it's a relatively demanding, yet also short-lived career. I do think that dancing has informed my music and greatly helped me understand the mechanisms of the human body.</p>

               <p>I never thought I would be in a band, but here I was, entering a complete stranger's home to play rock music. A long-time friend of mine (nineteen years now) asked if I was still in Kenosha and whether I'd be interested in playing in a rock band. She said the band was looking for a violinist specifically, and I figured I'd give it a shot. I honestly couldn't play much on that first "audition" night, but the band already had a couple of recordings online and I learned the parts for those. They were impressed with my technique and how quickly I pulled those two songs together (they were originals), so they welcomed me into the band. Gina, the lead singer, had just gotten six procedures done on her throat and sinuses, so she couldn't sing or even talk the first few times I met her. She had a program on her computer that would speak whatever she typed into it for her. I sort of felt like I was jumping in blind (maybe deaf is more accurate) by joining a band with a singer I hadn't actually heard singing, but I had a good feeling about the band. Also, Gina has a culinary degree and makes great food. She made tortellini the first night that I visited the house, and I'm a big fan of pasta, so that may have put me in a good mood before practice. Her cooking usually puts everyone in a pretty good mood.</p>

                  <figcaption>Band introductions: Daniel plays the bass and sings if we really insist, Jake played the drums and sang harmonies (more on that in a minute), Gina sings, and Paul plays the guitar and sings harmonies. Now I play and sing harmonies too. It's super hard to play the violin and sing at the same time, so I don't sing on every song.</figcaption>

               <p>A few months after I joined the band, Jake got accepted to a prestigious program for animation. He left the band to pursue his education. Because of this, we needed a new drummer. I had a friend from college who was still making music in the area. She had a band called Miss B Haven (her name is Haven, but sometimes she goes by Miss B on stage). However, her band dissolved because her guitarist decided to focus on solo music. We were happy to add her talents to the group, and now we have three ladies on stage! We love being a female-fronted band. Our manager still counts as a member of the band, so we don't quite claim to have a female majority.</p>

               <p>Recording this album was a labor of love. We recorded at a studio in Menomonee Falls, which is an hour away on a good day. The five of us tried to be there for the recording process every Saturday for about eight weeks last summer. Recording usually lasted for the entire day, going from around 9:00 in the morning to 5:00 or even 6:00 in the evening. We booked a very heavy calendar, sometimes three shows in one weekend, in order to afford the album production. Some studios charge by the hour and some charge by the day, but I believe ours charged by the song. There's also a mastering fee, probably some sort of registration so we can copyright our work, and printing for all the CDs (and other merchandise - shirts, stickers, et cetera). If I'm being candid, I didn't like the recording artist we recorded with. I feel like he didn't want to record with me in particular. I don't really know why, but I think he really just wanted the guitar to be the lead (our recording artist played the guitar and it was his favorite) and I was getting in the way of that. He wasn't very encouraging in the studio and I thought the overall professionalism of the studio was a little sloppy. I think about half the band was starstruck because he's worked with a few big-name artists, but I don't know much about popular music and I could really care less who he's worked with or which awards he's received (he later received the "Best Recording Artist in Wisconsin" title). I care what his work sounds like and whether I think that's the best we can do (I thought we could do better). I do think several tracks on the album sound great though, and the album release was a success. We sold our hundredth album just a few weeks ago. </p>

                  <h3>EP: Queen of Hearts</h3>
                  <p>We're not sure which songs will stay on the final lineup, but we're hoping to record four of our sassiest songs on this EP. Haven's working on the album art now. I requested that we look into working with a different recording artist, so Gina is meeting with a promising option soon and we'll see where it goes from there.</p>
                  <h3>EP: The Ballads</h3>
                  <p>This EP will hold slower ballad-type songs that don't necessarily fit with our other music. Gina wrote several songs for her dad, who was stuck in Florida battling his demons for many years.</p>
                  <h3>Complete Equipment Setup</h3>
                  <p>The band currently has a sound board, in-ear monitors for each person, and two stand-mounted loudspeakers. We still need two subwoofer speakers - and if we buy those, we'll need a trailer to hold and transport all our equipment. The band has been budgeting carefully for the past few years in order to purchase these items. After our setup is complete, the band hopes to start small payouts for each show - probably $15-20 per show. It's not going to pay the bills, but it'll pay for gas and instrument repairs!</p>
                  <h3>2023 Summer Tour</h3>
                  <p>This tour would probably go down south - Daniel is from St. Louis and Paul has a sister living in New Orleans. There aren't many details yet. On the bright side, paying for this trip would be budgeted from the band fund and we would have minimal out-of-pocket costs.</p>
